When I visisted the city for the first time, I was simultaneously blown away at the amounnt of food not normally found in Texas and at the lack of one of our staples: Mexican food. Given Asian and Mexican dishes contain similar taste profiles and ingredients, I believe this may be an opportunity to identify and capitalize on a gap in the market. Foursquare data is an excellent starting point for this solving this problem as it can plot the current availability of Mexican food on a map. This analysis would aid in an entrepreneur's mission to gauge demand and identify \"under-served\" locations regarding Mexican cuisine in Toronto. Ideally, the location provided from this analysis would be a sound recommendation as to where this entrepreneur could build a successful brick-and-mortar business."
